typeID (1 byte), keyName (n-bytes+1 (for null-terminator)), value (n-bytes)

00000010, 00000001 00000001 00000000, 00000001 00000001 00000001 00000000

oh it's a byte.
read next bytes and add to character array but stop when byte is 0.
Now, because it's a byte read next byte (and that's the value).
now end.

oh it's a string
read next bytes and add to character array but stop when byte is 0.
now read next bytes and add to character array but stop when byte is 0.
